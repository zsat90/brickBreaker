# Brick Breaker

# Overview

In this project, I developed a classic Brick Breaker game to further my understanding of game development, collision detection, and software architecture. In Brick Breaker, the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen, using it to bounce a ball upwards to break bricks arranged at the top. The goal is to clear all the bricks without letting the ball pass through the paddle. The game ends when all bricks are cleared or the player loses all their lives.

The purpose of writing this software was to explore the principles of game design and development, enhance my problem-solving skills, and gain hands-on experience with Pygame, a popular Python library for making video games. This project allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical, fun context, and learn about game loops, event handling, and physics simulation.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

- PyCharm: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python, which provided a comprehensive set of tools for writing and testing Python code.
- Python 3: The programming language used for the game development, chosen for its readability and vast ecosystem of libraries.
- Pygame: A Python library designed for writing video games. It offers modules for sprites, sound, and event management, making it easier to create games with interactive graphics and sound.

# Future Work

* Level Design: Introduce multiple levels with increasing difficulty, including different brick arrangements and possibly moving bricks.
* Power-Ups: Implement power-ups that the player can collect to gain special abilities, such as a wider paddle, multi-ball play, or slow-motion.
* High Score System: Create a system to save and display high scores, encouraging players to beat their own records.
* Graphics Improvement: Update the game's visuals with more sophisticated graphics and animations for the ball, paddle, and bricks.
